On the **Create a Group** page, you can create and customize a new Connect group. While creating your group, give it a (1) name, category and description, and (2) a profile picture.


You'll also have the opportunity to add (3) additional group administrators, called **Owners** here, and (4) users who are whitelisted, whose messages will bypass moderation.


.. image:: images/image24.png


On this page, you'll also decide (1) whether or not the group is official (managed staff members of your organization), (2) if other users can join the group without being invited, (3) whether or not the group will appear to other Connect users, (4) if posts to the group are moderated, and (5) if other users can see who is a member of the group.

If your group has a location, you'll choose where (1) the group is located, and (2) pick a display location that will show on your group description. Finally, click the **Create group** button to create your group.

Message Moderation
==================

In this section, we'll cover (1) finding messages to moderate and (2) moderating messages.


1. Finding messages to moderate


From any screen on Connect, the **Messages** option in the navigation bar will indicate the total number of messages available for you.


This number includes: unread messages from groups you're a member of, messages pending moderation, or pending group join requests.

.. image:: images/image30.png


To access the **Message Moderation** panel, Connect administrators have two options:


A. Click the **Messages** from the Connect navigation bar to go to your Connect inbox. From there, click the link that says **You have messages to moderate**.


.. image:: images/image26.png


B. Choose **Message Moderation** from the Connect navigation bar


.. image:: images/image48.png


2. Moderating messages


From the **Message Moderation** panel, you'll see a preview of the messages available to moderate.


To see the full message pending, in context of the thread it was posted to, click the subject line of the message.

.. image:: images/image08.png


Now you can read the entire message, and where it fits within the thread. Click the arrows at the bottom of the page to expand and contract the view of the entire thread.


.. image:: images/image05.png


Back in the **Message Moderation** panel, you can choose to **Approve** or **Veto** (reject) messages from your group in two ways. (1) Click the **Approve** or **Veto** button associated with each message, or, (2) moderate all messages in bulk by clicking the **Approve** or **Veto** options next to Actions. Then click (3) **Save changes**.

Flag Moderation Log
===================

Any member of a group can flag messages as inappropriate by clicking the flag icon located on the bottom right corner of a message.


.. image:: images/image12.png


.. image:: images/image13.png


Once the message is flagged, it is removed from view by all group members, except the member who originally posted the message.


Flagged messages will appear in your **Message Moderation** panel for further review. If you decide to veto a message, it will be permanently removed from the group. If you choose to approve the message, it will be returned to the group.


.. image:: images/image49.png


When a flagged message is either approved or vetoed, it will appear in your **Flag Moderation Log**, You can access the **Flag Moderation Log** from the **Admin** menu on the Connect navigation bar.


.. image:: images/image03.png


In the **Flag Moderation Log**, you can see (1) the subject line of the flagged message, (2) who flagged the message and when, (3) who moderated the message and when, and (4) the action taken on the message.

The **Flag Moderation Log** is especially helpful if you have multiple administrators in a single group.
